Open source UKlegal self-help toolkit
# Justice App (Working Title)

An open-source toolkit to help ordinary people in the UK access justice without expensive lawyers.  
This project focuses on **civil law** and **family law**, where legal aid is limited and many people are left to represent themselves.  

## ‚ú® What it does
- Guides you step-by-step through common civil and family law issues.  
- Provides plain-English explanations of the law.  
- Supplies ready-to-use templates (letters, forms, court bundles) you can fill in yourself.  
- Explains court procedures so you know what to expect.  
- Focuses on self-representation and empowerment.  

## üöß Status
This is an early work-in-progress. Currently building the first **landing page** and basic app structure.  

## üí° Vision
The long-term goal is to make legal self-help simple, accessible, and fair ‚Äî so that ordinary working people can stand up to companies, landlords, or institutions without being crushed by lawyer costs.  

## ‚öñÔ∏è Disclaimer
This tool does **not** provide legal advice and is not a substitute for a solicitor or barrister.  
It is for **educational and self-representation purposes only**.  
For criminal matters, always seek professional legal help.
